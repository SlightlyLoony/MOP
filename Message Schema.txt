Standard MOP message schemas (for fields outside the envelope):

Monitor messages:
   JVM:
      monitor.jvm.usedBytes           (long)    memory allocated and actually being used, both code and data
      monitor.jvm.freeBytes           (long)    memory allocated by not currently in use
      monitor.jvm.allocatedBytes      (long)    memory allocated (sum of used and free memory)
      monitor.jvm.availableBytes      (long)    memory that is currently unallocated, but which the JVM will try to allocate if needed
      monitor.jvm.maxBytes            (long)    memory that the JVM could use (sum of allocated and available)
      monitor.jvm.cpus                (int)     number of CPUs available to the JVM
      monitor.jvm.totalThreads        (int)     total number of active threads
      monitor.jvm.newThreads          (int)     new threads that have not yet started
      monitor.jvm.runningThreads      (int)     running threads
      monitor.jvm.blockedThreads      (int)     threads blocked on a monitor
      monitor.jvm.waitingThreads      (int)     threads waiting for another thread
      monitor.jvm.timedWaitingThreads (int)     threads waiting for another thread, up to a certain time
      monitor.jvm.terminatedThreads   (int)     threads that have terminated

   OS:
      monitor.os.valid                (boolean) true if the results are valid; false otherwise
      monitor.os.errorMessage         (string)  present only for invalid results
      monitor.os.os                   (string)  operating system type (OSX or Linux)
      monitor.os.hostName             (string)  host name, as reported by uname
      monitor.os.kernelName           (string)  kernel name, as reported by uname
      monitor.os.kernelVersion        (string)  kernel version, as reported by uname
      monitor.os.architecture         (string)  processor architecture, as reported by uname
      monitor.os.totalMemory          (long)    total memory (RAM) in the machine
      monitor.os.usedMemory           (long)    memory in use (includes OS, swap, and application)
      monitor.os.freeMemory           (long)    memory not in use
      monitor.os.cpuBusyPct           (float)   CPU percent busy (0..100) (past 60 seconds on OSX, one second on Linux)
      monitor.os.cpuIdlePct           (float)   CPU percent idle (0..100) (past 60 seconds on OSX, one second on Linux)
